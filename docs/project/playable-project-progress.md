# Playable Project Progress

## Current Snapshot - 2026-07-09

The active project is now the BusLoop mechanic lab, not an advertising playable. The lab is for designing and experiencing gameplay mechanisms and contains no active advertising package flow or store redirect.

### Mechanic Lab Foundation

- The registry contains one playable `base` rule set plus ten complete mechanism definitions currently marked `planned`.
- The shell provides a searchable mechanism library, desktop three-column layout, mobile drawers, mechanism detail/overlay states, `?mechanic=` selection, invalid-ID fallback, and planned-mechanic input freeze.
- The base runtime, level12-style data, Three.js scene, audio, win/fail/reset flow, QA API, and scene editor remain available.
- Scene tuning now preserves authored defaults before applying local overrides; storage read/write/migration/removal failures are non-fatal.

### Advertising Cleanup And Runtime Assets

- CTA/store routing, install gates, MRAID startup, advertising package scripts/checkers, generated package artifacts, and platform-specific runtime ownership were removed.
- Active compressed web assets moved to neutral `/assets/runtime/...` paths. Unity source/export assets remain under `/assets/unity/...`.
- Historical platform and playable-delivery documents remain for provenance but are no longer the default workflow.

### Verification

- Targeted lab tests: `node --test test/mechanic-registry.test.js` passed 23/23.
- Production build: `npm run build` passed with the existing Vite large-chunk warning.
- Full suite: `npm test` passed 67/74. The seven existing `test/game-model.test.js` failures are recorded in `task_plan.md`; the full suite is not green.
- Browser visual QA passed on desktop 1440x1000 and mobile 390x844 using Playwright with system Edge: canvas pixel checks were nonblank, mobile library/editor drawers started collapsed, planned-mechanic overlays paused input, base gameplay click worked after returning from preview, and there were no console errors or failed HTTP responses.

### Next Step

Implement mechanisms one at a time behind the lab boundaries, starting with `question-vehicle` and `garage`. Keep each entry `planned` until its rules, focused tests, and desktop/mobile browser QA are complete.

## Historical Playable/Advertising Log

The entries below describe the repository before or during the conversion to the mechanic lab. They are retained as implementation history and are not the current SOP.

### Historical Snapshot - 2026-07-08

The project moved from the original 6-vehicle level1 prototype to the imported level12-style playable layout on 2026-07-07. The active runtime now targets `GameSceneDualQueue2` with 94 visible vehicles, two fixed passenger queues, authored depth blockers, Unity-style motion/effects/audio, and editor controls for major visual tuning.

## Completed On 2026-07-09

## 2026-07-09 CTA fixed editor-pixel size package refresh

- Changed CTA width, height, padding, font size, line height, and stroke width to use the editor tuning values as fixed CSS pixels in the final runtime; CTA position still uses the world-coordinate anchor.
- Regenerated `artifacts/applovin/index.html` from Vite bundle `index-DHZIWUN8.js`; final single HTML is 3,065,834 bytes (2.924 MiB).
- Verification: `node --check src/main.js`, `node --check test/game-model.test.js`, elevated targeted `main thread saves` test, elevated `npm run build`, built bundle `node --check`, `npm run package:applovin`, `npm run check:applovin`, and source/final package string checks passed. Sandboxed targeted test/build still hit Windows `spawn EPERM` before elevated reruns passed.

## 2026-07-09 CTA phone-preview size consistency package refresh

- Changed CTA size interpretation back to 1080-design-space scaling for width, height, padding, font size, line height, and stroke width, so values tuned in phone-preview editor mode render at the same relative size in the final package; CTA position still follows the world-coordinate anchor.
- Regenerated `artifacts/applovin/index.html` from Vite bundle `index-wZZxcaWN.js`; final single HTML is 3,065,934 bytes (2.924 MiB).
- Verification: `node --check src/main.js`, `node --check test/game-model.test.js`, elevated targeted `main thread saves` test, elevated `npm run build`, built bundle `node --check`, `npm run package:applovin`, `npm run check:applovin`, source checks for `scaledPx(..., uiScale)`, and final package string checks for the CTA size/world config passed. Sandboxed `node --test` and `npm run build` still hit Windows `spawn EPERM` before elevated reruns passed.

## 2026-07-09 CTA size tuning package refresh

- Applied the screenshot CTA size tuning to source and exported tuning: `height 73`, `stretchX 2.83`, `fontSize 32`, and `fontHeight 64`; the existing fixed-size behavior and world anchor remain unchanged.
- Regenerated `artifacts/applovin/index.html` from Vite bundle `index-FpSv9k5p.js`; final single HTML is 3,065,918 bytes (2.924 MiB).
- Verification: `node --check src/scene-tuning.js`, `node --check test/game-model.test.js`, source/exported CTA config check, elevated `npm run build`, built bundle `node --check`, `npm run package:applovin`, `npm run check:applovin`, and final package string checks for the CTA size/world config passed. Sandboxed `npm run build` still hit Windows `spawn EPERM` before the elevated rerun passed.

## Completed On 2026-07-08

## 2026-07-08 CTA fixed-size package refresh

- Changed CTA sizing so button width, height, padding, font size, line height, and stroke width use fixed CSS pixels from tuning instead of scaling with device/stage width; CTA position still follows the world-coordinate anchor.
- Regenerated `artifacts/applovin/index.html` from Vite bundle `index-DZ3DdzZm.js`; final single HTML is 3,065,920 bytes (2.924 MiB).
- Verification: `node --check src/main.js`, `node --check test/game-model.test.js`, elevated targeted `main thread saves` test, elevated `npm run build`, built bundle `node --check`, `npm run package:applovin`, `npm run check:applovin`, and final package string checks for the CTA world anchor passed. Sandboxed `node --test` and `npm run build` still hit Windows `spawn EPERM` before elevated reruns passed.

## 2026-07-08 CTA world-coordinate package refresh

- Applied the screenshot CTA world anchor to source and exported tuning: `worldX 0`, `worldY 0.99`, `worldZ 11.57`.
- Regenerated `artifacts/applovin/index.html` from Vite bundle `index-NGI5-RRW.js`; final single HTML is 3,065,936 bytes (2.924 MiB).
- Verification: `node --check src/scene-tuning.js`, `node --check test/game-model.test.js`, `artifacts/scene-tuning.json` parse/config check, elevated `npm run build`, built bundle `node --check`, `npm run package:applovin`, `npm run check:applovin`, and final package string checks for the CTA world anchor passed. Sandboxed `npm run build` still hit Windows `spawn EPERM` before the elevated rerun passed.

## 2026-07-08 CTA world-anchored positioning

- Changed CTA positioning so the DOM button is anchored by fixed scene/world coordinates (`cta.worldX/Y/Z`) and projected through the active Three.js camera, while the old design-space `cta.x/y` remains as a fallback.
- Added editor controls for the CTA world anchor and synced the exported tuning JSON; the default anchor preserves the current visual placement at `worldX 0`, `worldY 0`, `worldZ 10.2604`.
- Verification: `node --check` passed for `src/main.js`, `src/scene-view.js`, `src/scene-tuning.js`, `src/scene-editor.js`, and `test/game-model.test.js`; `artifacts/scene-tuning.json` parsed successfully; elevated targeted `main thread saves` coverage passed. The paired `editor sizing` target still hits the existing background-dimension assertion (`65536 !== 2100`).

## 2026-07-08 CTA center-relative AppLovin package

- Regenerated the AppLovin single-HTML package after the CTA center-relative positioning logic update; final output is `artifacts/applovin/index.html` from Vite bundle `index-CGzi8wTG.js`.
- Verification: sandboxed `npm run build` still hit Windows `spawn EPERM`, elevated `npm run build` passed with the existing Vite `>500 kB` chunk warning, then `npm run package:applovin`, `npm run check:applovin`, built bundle `node --check`, and final package string checks for CTA config/store routing passed. Final single HTML is 3,065,418 bytes (2.923 MiB).

## 2026-07-08 CTA center-relative positioning logic

- Changed CTA runtime positioning so `cta.x/y` are resolved as offsets from the 1080x2160 design center and then applied to the actual stage center, preventing device aspect/height changes from shifting the button by top-left anchoring.
- No package was regenerated for this logic-only update.
- Verification: `node --check src/main.js`, `node --check test/game-model.test.js`, direct position math checks, and elevated targeted `node --test --test-name-pattern "main thread saves" test/game-model.test.js` passed. Sandboxed targeted Node test still hit Windows `spawn EPERM` before the elevated rerun passed.

## 2026-07-08 CTA screenshot tuning package refresh

- Applied the screenshot CTA tuning values to `src/scene-tuning.js` and `artifacts/scene-tuning.json`: `x 540`, `y 1981`, `height 140`, `stretchX 2.83`, `fontSize 59`, `fontHeight 100`, `strokeWidth 2.9`, `pulseScale 1.15`, and `pulseSpeed 0.21`; stroke color was intentionally left unchanged.
- Regenerated `artifacts/applovin/index.html` from Vite bundle `index-BHpnsInC.js`; final single HTML is 3,065,333 bytes (2.923 MiB).
- Verification: `node --check src/scene-tuning.js`, `node --check test/game-model.test.js`, `artifacts/scene-tuning.json` parse check, elevated `npm run build`, `npm run package:applovin`, `npm run check:applovin`, direct `SCENE_TUNING.cta` import check, and final package string checks passed. The targeted `editor sizing` test still reaches an unrelated existing background-dimension assertion before CTA checks (`65536 !== 2100`).

## 2026-07-08 install gate real-device gesture fix

- Changed the 10-vehicle install gate so the 10th successful vehicle dispatch calls `InstallFullGame()` immediately inside the same pointer/user gesture, while arrival-state scanning remains as a non-duplicating fallback.
- Regenerated `artifacts/applovin/index.html` from Vite bundle `index-9-PiTtp-.js`; final single HTML is 3,065,334 bytes (2.923 MiB).
- Verification: `node --check src/main.js`, `node --check test/game-model.test.js`, elevated targeted `node --test --test-name-pattern "main thread saves" test/game-model.test.js`, elevated `npm run build`, `npm run package:applovin`, and `npm run check:applovin` passed. Sandboxed targeted test and build still hit Windows `spawn EPERM` before elevated reruns passed.

## 2026-07-08 iOS AppLovin store jump hardening

- Changed store routing so iOS MRAID clicks first open `itms-apps://itunes.apple.com/app/id6746743297`, then fall back to the Apple web URL on later attempts; Android keeps the Google Play URL.
- Replaced the one-time `hasOpenedStore` lock with a short click cooldown so a silently blocked first iOS attempt does not make later CTA/install-gate taps inert. iPadOS detection now also handles `Macintosh` touch user agents.
- Regenerated `artifacts/applovin/index.html` from Vite bundle `index-CuqeIwdT.js`; final single HTML is 3,094,762 bytes (2.951 MiB).
- Verification: `node --check src/main.js`, `node --check scripts/check-applovin-package.mjs`, `node --check test/game-model.test.js`, elevated targeted `node --test --test-name-pattern "main thread saves" test/game-model.test.js`, elevated `npm run build`, `npm run package:applovin`, and `npm run check:applovin` passed. The checker now includes an iOS direct-scheme assertion.

## 2026-07-08 CTA design-coordinate positioning

- Changed CTA tuning from bottom/safe-area anchoring to design-coordinate center positioning with configurable `cta.x` and `cta.y`; added separate `cta.fontHeight` control for text line-height independent of font size.
- Updated editor controls, source tuning, exported tuning JSON, and source-contract assertions. No package was regenerated for this change.
- Verification: `node --check src/main.js`, `node --check src/scene-tuning.js`, `node --check src/scene-editor.js`, `node --check test/game-model.test.js`, elevated targeted `node --test --test-name-pattern "main thread saves" test/game-model.test.js`, and `artifacts/scene-tuning.json` parse check passed.

## 2026-07-08 height-lock 14.9 trial package

- Changed `calculateDesignCoverHalfHeight()` back to fixed visible-height behavior for the current device test: all viewport aspects use `camera.fitHeight` as the vertical visible height, so `fitHeight: 14.9` stays 14.9 on short and tall screens while wider screens only reveal more horizontal content.
- Regenerated `artifacts/applovin/index.html` from fresh Vite bundle `index-DEayjv3w.js`.
- Verification: `node --check src/scene-layout.js`, `node --check test/scene-layout.test.js`, elevated `node --test test/scene-layout.test.js`, direct math checks, elevated `npm run build`, `npm run package:applovin`, and `npm run check:applovin` passed. Final single HTML is 3,057,989 bytes (2.916 MiB), contains the fixed-height helper `return Math.max(.01,Number(fitHeight)/2||.01)` in minified form, keeps production preview-frame disabled, and contains no production `localStorage.getItem`.

## 2026-07-08 production preview-frame bypass for responsive camera

- Fixed the final package path that prevented responsive camera math from taking effect: `applyPreviewFrame()` now enables the 1080x2160 phone preview frame only in Vite dev/editor mode, so production/AppLovin keeps `#stage` full-screen and `SceneView.resize()` reads the real device/container aspect instead of a forced design-aspect preview box.
- Regenerated `artifacts/applovin/index.html` from fresh Vite bundle `index-B5E56wTh.js`.
- Verification: `node --check src/main.js`, `node --check test/game-model.test.js`, elevated targeted `node --test --test-name-pattern "main thread saves" test/game-model.test.js`, elevated `npm run build`, `npm run package:applovin`, and `npm run check:applovin` passed. Final single HTML is 3,058,131 bytes (2.916 MiB), contains no production `localStorage.getItem`, and the minified production flag used for `is-phone-preview` is `false`.

## 2026-07-08 short-screen design-cover zoom-out restored

- Changed `calculateDesignCoverHalfHeight()` so screens wider than the 1080x2160 design aspect increase camera visible height by `viewportAspect / designAspect`, making short/wide devices zoom out and reveal a wider authored scene instead of staying height-locked and enlarged.
- Regenerated `artifacts/applovin/index.html` from fresh Vite bundle `index-D4kfUfRI.js`.
- Verification: `node --check src/scene-layout.js`, `node --check test/scene-layout.test.js`, elevated `node --test test/scene-layout.test.js`, direct math checks, elevated `npm run build`, `npm run package:applovin`, and `npm run check:applovin` passed. Final single HTML is 3,058,135 bytes (2.916 MiB). The 612x916 case now computes visible height 19.91 and visible width 13.30.

## 2026-07-08 production tuning-cache bypass and AppLovin refresh

- Changed production/AppLovin startup so editor `localStorage` tuning is ignored outside Vite dev mode; the delivery package now uses only the baked `src/scene-tuning.js` values, avoiding stale device/platform preview cache overriding camera adaptation changes.
- Regenerated `artifacts/applovin/index.html` from fresh Vite bundle `index-Dt9kM1QW.js`.
- Verification: `node --check src/main.js`, `node --check test/game-model.test.js`, elevated targeted `node --test --test-name-pattern "main thread saves" test/game-model.test.js`, elevated `npm run build`, `npm run package:applovin`, and `npm run check:applovin` passed. Final single HTML is 3,057,993 bytes (2.916 MiB) and contains no production `localStorage.getItem` tuning reads.

## 2026-07-08 fresh-build AppLovin package after height-lock adaptation

- Regenerated `artifacts/applovin/index.html` from a user-run fresh Vite build bundle `index-BluE9YwH.js`, replacing the earlier package produced from a patched `dist` bundle.
- Verification: `node --check dist/assets/index-BluE9YwH.js`, `npm run package:applovin`, `npm run check:applovin`, and a manual `node --check` of the final inline module passed. Final single HTML is 3,058,707 bytes (2.917 MiB) and contains the height-lock helper `return Math.max(.01, Number(fitHeight) / 2 || .01)`, `camera.fitHeight` 14.9, and the latest CTA config.

## 2026-07-08 height-lock camera adaptation correction

- Changed `calculateDesignCoverHalfHeight()` to pure height-lock behavior: `camera.fitHeight` stays as the vertical visible height for all viewport aspects, so wider/shorter screens reveal more horizontal content without changing camera distance.
- Synced the current built bundle and regenerated `artifacts/applovin/index.html`; final single HTML is 3,058,843 bytes (2.917 MiB).
- Verification: `node --check src/scene-layout.js`, direct math checks, `node --check dist/assets/index-CA9mrv8c.js`, `npm run package:applovin`, `npm run check:applovin`, and a manual `node --check` of the final inline module passed. With `fitHeight` 14.9, visible height stays 14.9 at 1080x2160, 1080x1920, 720x1280, 1080x2400, and 1440x3200. Sandboxed `node --test test/scene-layout.test.js` remains blocked by Windows `spawn EPERM`.

## 2026-07-08 design-cover short-screen zoom-out correction

- Corrected `calculateDesignCoverHalfHeight()` so viewports wider than the 1080x2160 design aspect now zoom out with `baselineHalfHeight * viewportAspect / designAspect` instead of zooming in.
- Synced the current built bundle and regenerated `artifacts/applovin/index.html`; final single HTML is 3,058,853 bytes (2.917 MiB).
- Verification: `node --check src/scene-layout.js`, direct math checks, `node --check dist/assets/index-CA9mrv8c.js`, `npm run package:applovin`, `npm run check:applovin`, and a manual `node --check` of the final inline module passed. With `fitHeight` 14.9, visible heights are 14.9 at 1080x2160, 16.7625 at 1080x1920, 16.7625 at 720x1280, and 14.9 at 1080x2400. Sandboxed `node --test test/scene-layout.test.js` remains blocked by Windows `spawn EPERM`.

## 2026-07-08 CTA final package tuning refresh

- Updated CTA tuning to bottom `46`, height `113`, stretchX `2.95`, font size `47`, stroke width `2.9`, pulse scale `1.09`, and pulse speed `0.21` in `src/scene-tuning.js`, `artifacts/scene-tuning.json`, the current built bundle, and the AppLovin package.
- Verification: `node --check src/scene-tuning.js`, `node --check dist/assets/index-CA9mrv8c.js`, `npm run package:applovin`, `npm run check:applovin`, and a manual `node --check` of the final inline module passed. Final `artifacts/applovin/index.html` is 3,058,853 bytes (2.917 MiB) and contains the new CTA config with no old CTA config present.

## 2026-07-08 AppLovin loading 0% package fix

- Fixed the bad AppLovin package that stayed at 0% loading: the previous package had corrupted inline JS around non-ASCII end-panel text after direct bundle editing. Rebuilt from source, changed the end-panel title text in `src/main.js` to ASCII English, and regenerated `artifacts/applovin/index.html`.
- Hardened `scripts/check-applovin-package.mjs` with an inline module syntax check so corrupted inlined JS fails static validation before upload.
- Verification: user reran `npm run build`, then `npm run package:applovin` and `npm run check:applovin` passed. Additional manual extraction of the final inline module from `artifacts/applovin/index.html` passed `node --check`. Final single HTML is 3,058,850 bytes (2.917 MiB) and contains `camera.fitHeight` 14.9 plus the design-cover logic.

## 2026-07-08 camera fitHeight 14.9 AppLovin refresh

- Updated editor/exported camera tuning so `camera.fitHeight` is `14.9` in `src/scene-tuning.js`, `artifacts/scene-tuning.json`, and the current built `dist` bundle used for packaging.
- Regenerated `artifacts/applovin/index.html`; final single HTML is 3,058,846 bytes (2.917 MiB).
- Verification: `node --check src/scene-tuning.js`, `npm run package:applovin`, and `npm run check:applovin` passed. Final HTML contains `fitWidth:14.8,fitHeight:14.9,padding:.35`, keeps the design-cover `designWidth/designHeight` logic, and no longer contains the old `fitHeight:19.4` camera config.

## 2026-07-08 design-cover camera adaptation and AppLovin refresh

- Changed the crop-enabled camera adaptation to use the 1080x2160 design frame as a height-locked cover baseline: `camera.fitHeight` now controls visual scale, while `sourceCrop` keeps only background/target offset behavior and no longer zooms the camera out on short screens.
- Regenerated `artifacts/applovin/index.html` from the user-built `dist` bundle `index-CcEAXRhs.js` at 2026-07-08 16:29. Final single HTML is 3,058,846 bytes (2.917 MiB).
- Verification: `npm run package:applovin` and `npm run check:applovin` passed. Final HTML contains the compressed design-cover formula with `designWidth: 1080`, `designHeight: 2160`, `fitHeight: 19.4`, and fixed `shortScreenScale: 1`; the old short-screen crop constants `1366.875` and `1.125` are absent.

## 2026-07-08 short-screen camera fit fix and AppLovin refresh

- Fixed the short-screen adaptation so responsive source crop no longer reduces the authored camera fit bounds; crop-enabled rendering now uses the larger of `camera.fitWidth/fitHeight` and the responsive crop fit.
- Regenerated `artifacts/applovin/index.html` from fresh `dist` bundle `index-D_tbDuwl.js` built at 2026-07-08 15:47. Final single HTML is 3,058,808 bytes (2.917 MiB).
- Verification: `node --check` passed for `src/scene-layout.js` and `src/scene-view.js`; direct layout math check confirms 1080x1920 now keeps camera fit at 14.80 x 19.40 with visible height 26.31 instead of the old 16.32 crop fit; `npm run package:applovin` and `npm run check:applovin` passed, and final HTML contains the short-screen crop, camera max-fit logic, CTA tuning, and Android/iOS store URLs.

## 2026-07-08 AppLovin repackaged for responsive/CTA changes

- Regenerated `artifacts/applovin/index.html` from a fresh `dist` built at 2026-07-08 15:32 after the responsive crop and CTA/store-routing edits.
- Verification: package checks confirm the final HTML contains the responsive crop helper, `sourceCrop` tuning, scaled CTA CSS/JS, CTA tuning values, and Android/iOS store URLs. `npm run package:applovin` and `npm run check:applovin` passed. Final single HTML is 3,058,510 bytes (2.917 MiB).

## 2026-07-08 AppLovin package regenerated after latest local edits

- Regenerated the AppLovin single-HTML package from the current workspace contents at `artifacts/applovin/index.html`.
- Verification: sandboxed `npm run build` was blocked by Windows `spawn EPERM`, elevated `npm run build` passed with the existing Vite `>500 kB` chunk warning, then `npm run package:applovin` and `npm run check:applovin` passed. Final single HTML is 3,058,510 bytes (2.917 MiB).

## 2026-07-08 short-screen responsive crop source update

- Added responsive source-crop fit logic so screens shorter than the 1080x2160 baseline zoom the scene out by increasing the effective crop area, while the 1080x2160 baseline and taller screens keep the authored crop behavior.
- Changed `src/scene-view.js` to consume the shared crop-fit helper from `src/scene-layout.js`; updated layout tests and source-contract assertions for the new path.
- Verification: `node --check src/scene-layout.js` and `node --check src/scene-view.js` passed. Sandboxed `node --test` and `npm run build` are currently blocked by Windows `spawn EPERM`; elevated retries were rejected by the current Codex usage limit, so AppLovin package regeneration is still pending.

## 2026-07-08 Android/iOS store routing update

- Updated store routing in `src/main.js` to use the provided Android URL `https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=gridplus.busjam.carpuzzle` and iOS URL `https://apps.apple.com/app/id6746743297`.
- Added iOS detection for iPhone/iPad/iPod and touch-capable iPadOS-on-Mac user agents, plus a single `openStore()` path with duplicate open protection for CTA and install-gate clicks.
- Updated the AppLovin package URL allowlist for both store URLs and regenerated `artifacts/applovin/index.html`; final single HTML is 3,058,510 bytes (2.917 MiB).
- Verification: `node --check src/main.js`, `node --check scripts/check-applovin-package.mjs`, elevated targeted `node --test --test-name-pattern "main thread saves" test/game-model.test.js`, elevated `npm run build`, `npm run package:applovin`, and `npm run check:applovin` passed.

## 2026-07-08 AppLovin MRAID ready/default startup gate

- Added an explicit MRAID startup gate in `src/main.js`: local preview starts immediately when `window.mraid` is absent, AppLovin `loading` state waits for the `ready` event, and `default` or other already-available states start the runtime without delay.
- Updated the AppLovin static checker to fail final packages that only include `mraid.open` but lack the ready/default wait evidence, then regenerated `artifacts/applovin/index.html`.
- Verification: `node --check src/main.js`, `node --check scripts/check-applovin-package.mjs`, elevated targeted `node --test --test-name-pattern "main thread saves" test/game-model.test.js`, elevated `npm run build`, `npm run package:applovin`, and `npm run check:applovin` passed. Final single HTML is 3,057,660 bytes (2.916 MiB).

## 2026-07-08 CTA design-space scaling fix

- Changed CTA sizing so editor values such as height, bottom, font size, stroke width, and padding are treated as 1080-wide design-space values and scaled by the rendered stage width in both editor preview and production packages.
- Regenerated `artifacts/applovin/index.html`; final single HTML is 3,057,338 bytes (2.916 MiB).
- Verification: `node --check src/main.js` and AppLovin scripts passed; elevated `npm run build` passed after sandboxed Vite hit Windows `spawn EPERM`; `npm run package:applovin`, `npm run check:applovin`, elevated targeted `node --test --test-name-pattern "main thread saves" test/game-model.test.js`, and localhost browser preview passed. In the 342px-wide preview stage, the CTA now renders at about 65.6 x 22.0px instead of using the raw 203 x 68px design values.

## 2026-07-08 final AppLovin package refreshed with tuned web config

- Re-exported the adjusted web editor config from Edge localStorage key `bus-loop-scene-tuning-v3` into `artifacts/scene-tuning.json`, applied it to `src/scene-tuning.js`, then regenerated `artifacts/applovin/index.html`.
- Key applied values include camera elevation `61`, FOV `2.2`, target Z `1.8`, source crop offset Y `211`, CTA bottom `12`, CTA stretch X `2.98`, vehicle position scale `0.75`, and vehicle model scale `0.7`.
- Verification: `node --check` passed for tuning and AppLovin scripts; elevated `npm run build` passed after sandboxed Vite hit Windows `spawn EPERM`; `npm run package:applovin` and `npm run check:applovin` passed. Final single HTML is 3,056,955 bytes (2.915 MiB), contains no scene editor markers, includes the adjusted tuning values, and rendered successfully via localhost preview with no error-level console logs.

## 2026-07-08 AppLovin editor removal and tuning export path

- Changed `src/main.js` so the scene editor is loaded only in Vite dev mode; production/AppLovin runtime removes the editor mount and does not include editor code.
- Updated `scripts/package-applovin-single-html.mjs` to strip the editor mount and editor CSS from the AppLovin single HTML.
- Added `scripts/apply-scene-tuning.mjs` plus `npm run apply:tuning` so exported editor/localStorage tuning JSON can be merged into `src/scene-tuning.js` before production packaging.
- Verification: `node --check` passed for touched JS files; elevated `npm run build`, `npm run package:applovin`, `npm run check:applovin`, extracted inline-JS `node --check`, and browser preview passed. Final `artifacts/applovin/index.html` is 3,056,343 bytes and contains no `scene-editor`/editor UI markers.

## 2026-07-08 AppLovin single-HTML loading fix

- Fixed `scripts/package-applovin-single-html.mjs` so inlined CSS/JS insertion uses function replacers; this prevents minified `$&` sequences from being expanded into the matched `</head>` text and corrupting the module script.
- Regenerated `artifacts/applovin/index.html`; current single package is 3,073,516 bytes (2.931 MiB).
- Verification: `node --check scripts/package-applovin-single-html.mjs`, elevated `npm run build`, `npm run package:applovin`, `npm run check:applovin`, and extracted inline-JS `node --check` passed. Browser HTTP preview no longer stays on the 0% loading page and reaches the rendered game scene.

## 2026-07-08 MP3 audio switch and build size check

- Switched runtime audio references in `src/level-data.js` from WAV to the matching MP3 files under `public/assets/unity/audio`.
- Verification: `node --check src/level-data.js` passed; `npm run build` passed with the existing Vite `>500 kB` chunk warning after sandboxed build hit Windows `spawn EPERM`.
- Current `dist` output is 4,012,063 bytes across 51 files and includes only MP3 audio, so it is under the 5MB package-size limit but is not yet the AppLovin single-HTML/inline-resource final delivery format.

## 2026-07-08 install gate after successful vehicle arrivals

- Added AppLovin install gate state in `src/main.js`: count unique vehicles that have reached a parking spot from snapshot state as `numberCountBus`, set `isFinish` after `maxNumberCountBus = 10`, and route the next canvas click through `InstallFullGame()`.
- `InstallFullGame()` shares the CTA store open path and calls `mraid.open(...)` when available; CTA clicks stop propagation and open the store directly.
- Replaced the earlier `vehicle-arrived` event-only counter because later same-frame gameplay events can overwrite `lastEvent` before the UI sees it.
- Verification: `node --check src/main.js` and `node --check test/game-model.test.js` passed; elevated targeted `node --test --test-name-pattern "main thread saves" test/game-model.test.js` passed after sandboxed Node hit `spawn EPERM`.
## 2026-07-08 CTA button and AppLovin MRAID open

- Added the bottom CTA button using `Main_Prop_GreenBtn.png`, with configurable horizontal stretch, text size, text outline, and pulse animation.
- Fixed CTA hover so the global button hover style does not clear the image background.
- CTA clicks now call `mraid.open('https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?gl=US&hl=en-US&id=gridplus.busjam.carpuzzle')` when available, with `window.open` only as local-preview fallback.
- Verification: `node --check src/main.js`, `src/scene-tuning.js`, `src/scene-editor.js`, and `test/game-model.test.js` passed; elevated targeted `node --test --test-name-pattern "editor sizing|main thread saves" test/game-model.test.js` passed after sandboxed Node hit `spawn EPERM`.
- Added a passenger material mode switch: default `unityTexture` keeps the existing Unity color texture restoration, while `solidColor` drives passenger color from one configured hex per color index without assigning color texture maps. VAT animation texture usage remains unchanged.
- Verification: `node --check` passed for `src/scene-view.js`, `src/scene-tuning.js`, `src/scene-editor.js`, `src/main.js`, and `test/game-model.test.js`; elevated targeted `node --test --test-name-pattern "editor sizing|main thread saves" test/game-model.test.js` passed after sandboxed Node test runner hit `spawn EPERM`.
- Optimized passenger color picking/editing: passenger material `needsUpdate` now only fires when texture map state changes, single color-index edits only refresh matching passenger materials, and scene tuning saves are debounced with a final `beforeunload` flush.
- Verification: `node --check` passed for `src/scene-view.js`, `src/scene-tuning.js`, `src/scene-editor.js`, `src/main.js`, and `test/game-model.test.js`; elevated targeted `node --test --test-name-pattern "editor sizing|main thread saves" test/game-model.test.js` passed after sandboxed Node test runner hit `spawn EPERM`.

## Completed On 2026-07-07

- Imported the active level layout from the level12 source data: 94 vehicles, two 219-group fixed queues, authored blocker lists, and initial movable vehicles `1, 4, 34, 51`.
- Added gameplay/audio parity for collision, passenger boarding, and full-vehicle departure sounds using Unity-named audio assets.
- Improved passenger entrance motion by reusing the full queue-entry path for non-initial refills.
- Added or tuned vehicle departure path controls, full-load delay, count-board decrement behavior, and placeholder passenger visibility.
- Added Effect_Hit and Effect_SmokeTrail parity, then kept authored fake shadows as the active shadow solution after removing the heavier real-time shadow-map path.
- Added directional-light/editor controls, passenger material controls, vehicle arrow outline controls, and Map Scale editor naming.
- Restored bus/van fake shadow sizing and removed the bottom operation toast while preserving gameplay events/audio/end panel.

## Current Verification State

- Many touched files passed `node --check` during the 2026-07-07 sessions.
- Several targeted tests passed with elevated execution where sandboxed Node child process spawning hit `EPERM`.
- Some full test/build runs passed with the existing Vite `>500 kB` chunk warning.
- Later queue/conveyor full-suite verification was blocked by existing blocker-test expectation failures and then by usage-limit rejection for elevated build execution.

## Historical Risks / Follow-Up From Playable Phase

- At that point, the playable project still needed a full `node --test` re-check when the environment allowed child-process spawning reliably.
- Existing blocker expectation failures around querying blockers while a vehicle is colliding still needed investigation.
- Level12 gameplay, passenger entry, effects, audio timing, fake shadows, and material colors still needed comparison against the Unity reference.
- Platform packaging was intentionally paused during the old AppLovin playable phase; it is no longer part of the active mechanic-lab workflow.
